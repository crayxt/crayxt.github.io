<p>Hi! Here I am, back to blogging, and, hopefully, back to develop Kazsid.</p>
<p>Don't hold your breath - there is no new release except for the planned one, and it is on its way. Do you want to get your own, self-customized, new and shiny Kazsid build? Your dream is possible to realize now. We did publish the build tree of Kazsid. Kazsid is based on Debian Live project and it is a pure Debian system, with our slight customization and packages set. Currently, with only Russian and Kazakh locales, it fits on 1 CD, and that's great.</p>
<p>You can get the sources from the Github (Great resource, by the way).</p>
<p>Check it out here: <a href="https://github.com/crayxt/kazsid" target="_blank">https://github.com/crayxt/kazsid</a></p>
<p>First of all, do read the <a href="http://live.debian.net/manual/en/html/live-manual.html">Debian Live manual</a>. You should have Debian testing/wheezy box. Install git, debootstrap, and live-build packages.</p>
<p>You can read how to build Kazsid from README file. This source tree may and will be changed eventually. I don't like its current implementation, actually. So, we'll see what happens. Any comments on realization and suggestions are welcome.</p>
<p>Thanks for you attention and good luck in the Linux world.</p>
