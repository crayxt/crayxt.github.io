<p style="text-align: justify;">Equinox themes are <a href="https://github.com/crayxt/kazsid/commit/66e543ce79493323f927a3b50bfe1abfe0005206" target="_blank">dropped</a> from Kazsid's default install. This happened because I found a new GTK2 theme called <a href="gnome-look.org/content/show.php/?content=121685" target="_blank">BSM Simple</a>, which is very nice-looking, but only depends on Clearlooks engine, and it works faster. And, I just liked it. Sure, you will like it too, but if not, please, build your own Kazsid! Seriously, it's fun.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also installed openSUSE 12.2 M1 to my netbook via the network, but I was not impressed of it. Not because it being Milestone release, but because they don't ship codecs on default installation media. This is really inconvenient for me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What else? Install Kazsid, Luke</p>
