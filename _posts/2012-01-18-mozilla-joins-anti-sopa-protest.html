<p>Just like the title says, Mozilla have joined the anti-SOPA protest and this is what Firefox shows you, when launched:</p>
<p><a href="http://baurzhan.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/01-mozilla-sopa.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1737" title="01-mozilla-sopa" src="http://baurzhan.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/01-mozilla-sopa.png" alt="" width="443" height="498" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And there is also the warning on the mozilla.org site. As they say in Internets, do call you congressman and ask what is he/she going to do about the SOPA. Do that, really.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for us, who owns only little blogs on their own, there is still a chance to be banned in case of any copyrighted content will be found on our sites. So, good luck with the protest, we are hoping for the best. Amen!</p>
