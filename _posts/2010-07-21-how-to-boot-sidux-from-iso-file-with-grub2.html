<p>There is no clear manual at sidux manuals. They only said, you should install their package named grub2-fll-iso or something like it. Sure, you can load and boot Sidux from iso file, in existing Linux installation, with grub2. I used Linux Mint 9.</p>
<p>Here is the part of my /boot/grub/grub.cfg</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>loopback loop (hd0,0)/sidux.iso</strong></pre>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>linux (loop)/boot/vmlinuz0.686 boot=fll fromiso=/sidux.iso</strong></pre>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>initrd (loop)/boot/initrd0.686</strong></pre>
<p>That's it. sidux.iso in located in my / directory, which is /dev/sda1</p>
