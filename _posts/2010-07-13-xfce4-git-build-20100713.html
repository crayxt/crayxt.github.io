<p>There are some troubles with orage, patch won't apply. Maybe this is related with new makepkg behavior, which now exits, if any error will occur. ;)</p>
<p>So, orage is excluded from this build. I will take a look at it later and will do my best to fix it.</p>
<p>And another change - I returned mousepad-git, instead of mousepad-0.3-git, which is currently doesn't support locales.</p>
