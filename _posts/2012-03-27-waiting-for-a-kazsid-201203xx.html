<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, things were pretty quiet last days on Open Source and Linux field, and thus my blog is quiet too. I just don't have anything really interesting to share with you, dear reader. Sorry for that, please go read Hacker News or Reddit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">About fresh Kazsid build - I am waiting for the 3.2.13 kernel to arrive to Debian sid, then new Kazsid will be uploaded for testing. As usual, I don't expect to receive many reviews of replies on what Kazsid should look like or what impression it gave.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I don't think that Kazsid's page on sourceforge worth the time I've spent on it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the way, new Deadbeef release 0.5.2 is <a href="http://deadbeef.sourceforge.net/posts/deadbeef_0.5.2_is_out.html" target="_blank">arrived</a>. Also, GNOME 3.4 will be released in a couple of days, and it brings updated Kazakh translations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>UPD:</strong> live-configÂ 3.0~a33-1 does not work at the moment, because of <a href="http://live.debian.net/gitweb?p=live-config.git;a=commitdiff;h=477c98a839292550f8a8143cc40250cf7d8e35cf" target="_blank">that commit</a>. Will wait till it fixed. I will keep you updated, and sorry for the delay. Have a good day!</p>
